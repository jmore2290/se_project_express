# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. It is an attempt by our development team to gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and test, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. We are laying the groundwork for our front end WTWR application to update clothing items, delete items, register users and much more with requests to the server (this application).  The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Techniques Used
-This is my first implementation of the route-model-controller convention for building a server application.  
-Project shows our mastery of the mongoose library and all related methods. 
-This project was also an excellent introduction to the various linters available to developers (ESlinter being the one used here) 

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
